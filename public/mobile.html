                <p>Polling consistently shows a majority of Australians support same-sex marriage — but opinions vary a lot
                    depending where you live.</p><a name="endheader"> </a>
                <p>A year ago, the ABC's Vote Compass asked Australians whether they agreed or disagreed with this statement:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Marriage should only be between a man and a woman</em>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>More than 1.2 million Australians responded, and a majority of people indicated support for same-sex marriage.</p>

                <p><strong>Keep in mind:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yes, this data is 12 months old, but it remains the most detailed nationwide snapshot of voters' views
                        on same-sex marriage.</li>
                    <li>Recent evidence suggests <a href="/news/mobile/2017-08-02/hilda-survey-marriage-equality-same-sex/8763124"
                            target="_self" title="">Australian opinion on same-sex marriage</a> is only moving in one direction.</li>
                    <li>Typical polls don't have a big enough sample size to provide data on a seat-by-seat basis. <strong>Vote Compass does</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So let's see what that views look like around the country.</p>

                <a name="scrollyteller"> </a><a name="mark"> </a><p>On this map, every electorate is shaded based on voters' support for same-sex marriage: <strong>blue seats </strong>are less supportive and <strong>orange seats </strong>are more supportive.</p><p>A quick look at the colouring reveals that, even in most of rural and regional Australia, a majority of voters support same-sex marriage.</p><p>But this bird's eye view doesn't tell the full story — it over-emphasises a handful of large regional electorates, while the much smaller seats in our big population centres remain basically invisible.</p><a name="markELECTORATEsydneyZOOM20HIDEtrue"> </a><p>Take Sydney, for instance. It's home to approximately one in every five Australians — meaning this grouping of electorates represents more people than the large rural seats that dominated the previous view.</p><a name="markELECTORATEsydneyANDchifleyZOOM20"> </a><p>A number of inner-Sydney suburbs register about 80 per cent support for same-sex marriage, among the strongest in the country, while the middle ring and western suburbs are around 50 per cent support.</p><a name="markELECTORATEwentworthANDparkesZOOM3"> </a><p>"There's a distinct 'inner city versus the rest' pattern," explains political scientist Shaun Ratcliff. "Outer-suburban areas and rural areas tend to be more conservative on this issue."</p><p>And this isn't just about Sydney. The pattern is the same nationwide: the closer you live to the inner city, the more likely you are to support same-sex marriage.</p><a name="markELECTORATEbrisbaneZOOM25"> </a><p>You can see the same thing clearly in Brisbane, where the four seats closest to the CBD register support of 60 to 70 per cent, while surrounding suburbs are closer to the 50 per cent mark.</p><p>One of the most striking things about this geographic pattern is it appears to be stronger than any link to party support.</p><a name="markELECTORATEgriffithANDbrisbaneANDryanANDlilleyZOOM50"> </a><p>Of those four inner-Brisbane seats that are most supportive of same-sex marriage, the Liberal National Party holds two and Labor holds two.</p><a name="markELECTORATEfordeANDrankinANDblairZOOM35"> </a><p>Similarly, the suburban seats where support drops to about the 50 per cent mark also elect a mix of LNP and Labor MPs.</p><p>"It doesn't matter which party represents the electorate, the geography seems to matter more" right across the country, Dr Ratcliff says.</p><a name="markELECTORATEmaranoaANDkennedyANDflynnANDcapricorniaANDgroomZOOM2"> </a><p>Once you zoom out from Brisbane, it becomes clear that Queensland is our most conservative state on this issue. In fact, the five electorates with the lowest support for same-sex marriage are all in Queensland.</p><p>At the top of that list is Maranoa, which has a reputation as the most conservative seat in the country. But even here, the picture is mixed: 42 per cent of voters back same-sex marriage, compared to 44 per cent who are opposed (leaving 14 per cent 'neutral').</p><a name="markELECTORATEmelbourneportsZOOM10"> </a><p>At the other end of the spectrum is Victoria, which is considered Australia's most socially progressive state.</p><a name="markELECTORATEmelbourneportsZOOM40"> </a><p>In Melbourne, the most supportive seats are almost 80 per cent in favour, and every seat in the state is above 50 per cent support.</p><a name="markELECTORATEmenziesZOOM40"> </a><p>But in the eastern suburbs, we see an example of a critical dichotomy in the politics of same-sex marriage in Australia.</p><p>"Parliament has been more conservative on this issue than the [Australian] electorate," Dr Ratcliff says. "Every survey I've seen since 2007 has had majority support for same-sex marriage."</p><p>Menzies is an example of this trend. Here, about 60 per cent of voters indicated support for same-sex marriage but the local MP, Liberal Kevin Andrews, remains one its most steadfast opponents.</p><a name="markELECTORATEwarringahZOOM40"> </a><p>We see the same, most famously, in Tony Abbott's seat of Warringah, where the former PM is a vocal campaigner for the 'no' cause, but most voters are in favour.</p><a name="markELECTORATEcanningANDperthZOOM10"> </a><p>On the other side of the country, Liberal MP Andrew Hastie has been another vocal opponent of same-sex marriage. His view is in line with about one-third of voters in his seat, Canning, whereas a small majority backs same-sex marriage.</p><a name="markELECTORATEdurackANDoconnorZOOM1"> </a><p>Notably, support tops 50 per cent in all of Western Australia's electorates.</p><a name="markELECTORATEgreyANDsolomonANDcanberraANDdenisonZOOM1"> </a><p>In fact, support is 50 per cent or above in all electorates in South Australia, the NT, the ACT and Tasmania as well. (You can tap on any electorate to see its level of support.)</p><a name="mark"> </a><p>Despite everything we can learn from this map, one thing it can't tell us is what percentage of people will back change in the current postal survey on same-sex marriage.</p><p>Because it's a voluntary survey, that will be determined by a mix of overall support and exactly which people are motivated to fill out and return their forms by the deadline.</p><a name="endscrollyteller"> </a>



                <p>Some text talking about the bar chart. (this will go just before the chart)</p><a name="chart"> </a>
                <p><strong>Just some notes</strong></p>
                <p>Warren Entsch is the Member for Leichhardt. Pushing the same-sex agenda for the Liberals. His seat is split
                    down the middle on the issue.</p>
                <p>Entsch was one of 5 pushing for a free vote. Dean Smith (Senator), Trent Zimmerman (North Sydney, 66%), Trevor
                    Evans (Brisbane 67%), Tim Wilson (Goldstein, 70%)</p>
                <p>Of the 10 seats most opposed to same-sex marriage, 7 are in Queensland. Barker and Grey in SA, plus Parkes
                    in NSW</p>
